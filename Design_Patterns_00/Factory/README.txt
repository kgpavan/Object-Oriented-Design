FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN
----------------------

The Factory Method Pattern gives us a way to encapsulate the instantiations of concrete types. The Factory Method pattern encapsulates the functionality required to select and instantiate an appropriate class, inside a designated method referred to as a factory method. The Factory Method selects an appropriate class from a class hierarchy based on the application context and other influencing factors. It then instantiates the selected class and returns it as an instance of the parent class type.
